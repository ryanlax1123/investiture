    A learning scaffold for designers who want to use Claude Code

<!-- What This Is / Is Not -->

      <h3 class="ethos__title">What This Is</h3>
      <p class="ethos__text">
        Investiture is an architecture scaffold — folders, separation of concerns, and a CLAUDE.md that teaches your AI assistant how to write clean code. It's a spaghetti-free zone for vibe coding. Clone it, open it in Claude Code, and start building. The structure keeps you from painting yourself into corners.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ethos__block">
      <h3 class="ethos__title">What This Is Not</h3>
      <p class="ethos__text">
        This is not Tailwind. This is not Bootstrap. Investiture gives you zero styles, zero layouts, zero components. Run it and you get a blank screen. That's the point. It's unopinionated about your UI — it only cares about where your code lives. Bring your own design system, or ask Claude to build one.

    <div class="ethos__block">
      <h3 class="ethos__title">The Problem</h3>
      <p class="ethos__text">
        You're a designer. You've seen what AI coding tools can do. You want in.
        But the code works until it doesn't, and you can't debug it.
        Terms like "services layer" and "state management" feel like a foreign language.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ethos__block">
      <h3 class="ethos__title">The Solution</h3>
      <p class="ethos__text">
        Investiture is engineering knowledge pre-loaded into a scaffold your AI can read.
        Work inside a system with guardrails built in.
        You don't have to become an engineer—just build inside structure that already knows the rules.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ethos__block">
      <h3 class="ethos__title">What You'll Learn</h3>
      <p class="ethos__text">
        Separation of concerns. Service abstraction. Design tokens. Content separation.
        The shape of real codebases—folders that make sense, files that have one job.
        Not from a tutorial. From doing.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ethos__block">
      <h3 class="ethos__title">Who It's For</h3>
      <p class="ethos__text">
        UX designers who want to build, not just wireframe.
        Design technologists leveling up their AI-assisted workflow.
        Anyone who's been "vibe-coding" and wants to understand why things work.

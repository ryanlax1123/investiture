## Project Structure

```
src/              — YOUR APP (start here)
  App.jsx         — Your main component
  App.css         — Your styles

design-system/    — Visual foundation
  tokens.css      — Colors, spacing, typography as CSS variables

content/          — User-facing strings
  en.json         — All text in one place

core/             — Pure business logic
  utils.js        — Helper functions (no side effects)

services/         — External integrations
  api.js          — API client (swap for your backend)

examples/         — Reference implementations
  App.jsx         — Counter, theme toggle, animations
```

---

## Architecture Rules

When adding features, follow this pattern:

1. **UI goes in src/** — Components, styles, layouts
2. **Strings go in content/** — No hardcoded text in components
3. **Styles use tokens** — Always use CSS variables from design-system/
4. **Logic goes in core/** — Pure functions, no API calls
5. **API calls go in services/** — All external data through services/

---

## Do Not

- Put API calls in components — use services/
- Hardcode colors — use design-system/tokens.css
- Inline user-facing strings — use content/en.json
- Mix business logic with UI — keep core/ pure

---

## How to Run

```
npm start        — Run your app (localhost:3000)
npm run examples — See the demo app (localhost:3001)
```

---

## Starter Prompts

Try these in Claude Code:

1. "Add a todo list that saves to localStorage"
2. "Add a dark mode toggle using the design tokens"
3. "Fetch data from an API and display it"
